## SparkSL Shader Examples


### Intro

This is a collection of heavily commented examples of how to write shaders in [SparkSL](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/sparksl/sparksl-overview). SparkSL is a shader language used in SparkAR that is cross compatible across iOS and android devices. It shares many similarities to GLSL but has a few quirks and nice additions of its own. 

This repo closely mirrors my other project of [p5js shader examples](https://github.com/aferriss/p5jsShaderExamples).

Currently a work in progress, feel free to get in touch if you've got any questions or file a PR if you'd like to contribute.
